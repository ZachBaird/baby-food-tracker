# Baby Food Tracker

This app was an idea from my wife. We just started giving our son baby foods. My wife lamented that there are no apps to track what foods a baby likes as they start out; I resolved to give her just the tool she'll need.

## Setup

1. Have Node.js installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Cd into `baby-food-tracker`
4. Run `npm i`
5. Create an `.env` file in the project root
6. Setup a Mongo db
```
NODE_ENV = 
PORT = 
MONGO_URI = 
```
7. Populate it with the following data:
8. Run `npm server`
9. Try making requests to the `/api/foodentries` endpoints

## Todos

* Start building out PWA UI
* Integrate users
